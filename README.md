🎓 **Multidisciplinary Professional | Data Analyst | HSE Specialist**

💼 I'm a data-driven professional with a background in Health, Safety & Environment (HSE).  

I specialize in leveraging data to drive safety, sustainability, and operational performance. I analyze and visualize HSE data to support compliance with international standards (e.g., ISO) and continuous improvement initiatives. Using Power BI and Tableau, I design dynamic dashboards that uncover trends and support decision-making. I rely on SQL and Python for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation, while using Excel (Power Query, VBA) for advanced analysis and automation.  

💡 My goal is to transform raw and complex data into actionable insights to support sustainability, operational efficiency, and safety.
